What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?
Timeboxing is a method of scheduling where you divide your time into "boxes" that are dedicated to specific tasks.
Timeboxing is most commonly done on calenders where it can be easily visualised.
I would like to use timeboxing more as I don't schedule anything outside of course schedule.

What is Python?
Python is one of many different coding languages that is commonly used for constructing programs, software, and web pages.
Python is commonly used because it is fairly easy to understand for new programmers and is a good general use code language.

Have you meditated before?
I have meditated along side course work and have also meditated a few times off site.
I find meditation to be most effective before doing work.

What is an IDE?
An integrated development environment is a software that is designed to make programming easier and more efficient.
An example of an IDE would be visual studio code.

What is OOP?
Object-oriented programming is programming that focuses on coding around objects or data rather than basic logic.
Object-oriented programming is used when designing and programming databases.

What is a variable?
A variable in programming is a method of storing data by assigning it a name so it can be stored or referred to.
Variables can be static or change within code.

If you were describing programming to someone who knows nothing about it, what would you say?
Programming is essentially writing out a set of instructions that the program will follow when the code is started.

What is a fixed mindset?
A fixed mindset is thinking that skill or the ability to be good at something is something that cannot be worked towards or improved upon.

Which parts of this course made you feel doubtful of your own innate ability?
I had initally forgotten most of python so learning new python alongside relearning old python felt a little overwhelming.

So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?
This assignment. I'm not the best at answering personal questions. I'm also not confident that my answers to questions are good enough.
Adding comments to the code also made me consider whether or not I knew what the code did.

What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism is when a function has multiple different uses but is called in the same way across all those different uses.
An example would be using len to check the length of a string (len("hello") which would print the number of letters being 5,
but len can also be used to check the length of a list (len([1, 2, 3])) which would print 3 since there are three records.
